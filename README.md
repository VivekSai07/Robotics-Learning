## Linear Algebra
**NullSpace.m**
- **Purpose**: Visualize the nullspace of a $2\times2$ matrix and animate an input vector moving along that nullspace.
- **Demonstrates**: `null(A)` computation, mapping $x = A*x$, and shows that vectors in the nullspace map to the zero vector.
- **Usage**: Run this script in MATLAB to see the input-space and output-space animations. Modify A at the top to test other matrices.

**VectorSpace.m**
- **Purpose**: Visualize the span of two vectors in $R^2$ and animate linear combinations across the span.
- **Demonstrates**: formation of linear combinations, plotting basis vectors, and visualizing the plane (span) generated by two vectors.
- **Usage**: Run this script to see the span animation. Change $\times1$ and $\times2$ at the top to explore different spans and linear dependence/independence.

**Determinant_Animation.m**
- **Purpose**: Animate a time-varying 2x2 linear transformation and illustrate how the determinant scales area.
- **Demonstrates**: transforming basis vectors, computing det(A), and showing the parallelogram area equal to |det(A)|.
- **Usage**: Run this script to watch the transformation evolve. Tweak the matrix definition inside the loop to try other animations.


## Kinematics
**FK.m**
- **Purpose**: Compute and plot forward kinematics of a 2-link planar manipulator for fixed joint angles.
- **Demonstrates**: basic FK equations and simple plotting of the manipulator configuration.
- **Usage**: Run this script in MATLAB. Edit link lengths or joint angles at the top to change the pose.


**FKAnim.m**
- **Purpose**: Animate forward kinematics of a 2-link planar manipulator as joint angles vary smoothly.
- **Demonstrates**: time-varying FK, updating plot handles efficiently, and realtime display of joint angles and end-effector position.
- **Usage**: Run this script in MATLAB; modify angle trajectories or link lengths to change the animation.


**TFs.m**
- **Purpose**: Compute transformation matrices for a 2-link planar manipulator and draw coordinate frames.
- **Demonstrates**: homogeneous transforms T01, T12, T02, extracting joint origins, and plotting frames.
- **Usage**: Run this script in MATLAB to visualize frames; inspect displayed T01, T12, T02 in the console.


**FKWithTFs.m**
- **Purpose**: Compute forward kinematics and draw local coordinate frames along a 2-link manipulator.
- **Demonstrates**: FK equations, frame drawing using simple helper, and annotated visualization of frames.
- **Usage**: Run this script in MATLAB; adjust link lengths and joint angles to see different frame placements.


**IK.m**
- **Purpose**: Compute analytical inverse kinematics for a 2-link planar manipulator and visualize the result.
- **Demonstrates**: elbow-up/down solutions, reachability check, and plotting of resulting configuration and target.
- **Usage**: Run this script in MATLAB; change target $(xd, yd)$ and link lengths to test other configurations.


**IKAnim.m**
- **Purpose**: Animate inverse kinematics for a 2-link planar robot following a circular end-effector path.
- **Demonstrates**: analytical IK for a 2-link arm, elbow-down solution, and realtime animation of the arm tracking a path.
- **Usage**: Run this script in MATLAB; modify the path or link lengths to test different trajectories.
